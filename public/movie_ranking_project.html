<h1>The Best Movies According to Sudha</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

<h3> Tamasha </h3>
<p> This is my favourite, because it takes me on quite a surreal experience whenever I watch it & it is quite underrated.</p>

<h3> Jab We Met </h3>
<p> I can rewatch it, like thousands of times. </p>

<h3> Race 3!</h3>
<p> Love Solmon bhoi </p>
